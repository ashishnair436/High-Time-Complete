# High-Time-Complete

This is a simple 3D game created by me and my friends for our first college project exhibition. This game has a few levels and a story for the main character. It's a simple game in which our main character Andriette has to fight off her demons and emerge victorious . With 3 different levels and unique gameplay and animation , this was one of the first games we have created.
